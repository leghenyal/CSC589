## CSC589: Final Project

**12.12.2017**

In this project, our objective was to classify a mixed series of pictures of dogs and food by fine-tuning a pre-trained AlexNet Deep Convolutional Neural Network cloned from [Frederik Kratzert’s GitHub](https://github.com/kratzert/finetune_alexnet_with_tensorflow)

Please note, before you can run this classification you must download the AlexNet weights ’bvlc_alexnet.npy’ available [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/) and place this file into the ‘code’ folder in order for the classification to work. It would be included if not for file size limits on GitHub and Blackboard.
